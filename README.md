# Aminate

By Amir Mansaray

A tabbed Maya toolset for animation workflow helpers.

## Sections In Use

The sections in regular use in this beta are:

- `Toolkit Bar` for the full dockable Toolkit Bar inside a tab, including History Timeline blocks, Animation Layer controls, timing buttons, Tween Machine, workflow icons, package zip, and Game Animation Mode
- `Scene Helpers` for Animation Layer Tint, camera presets, render setup, texture loading, game animation mode, hotkey Floating Channel Box, hotkey Floating Graph Editor, text notes, and teacher demo tools
- `Reference Manager` for saving the current scene and packaging Maya references, textures, image planes, audio, caches, and a manifest into one zip
- `Controls Retargeter (Face and Body)` for control-based retarget between rigs
- `Control Picker` for scene control mapping, grouping, reordering, attr lookup, synced Maya selection, and list / visual control maps
- `Animators Pencil` for Blue Pencil-style drawing, Photoshop-style shape tools, Camera Notes view keying, layers, frame markers, ghosting, retiming, and scene-native annotation marks
- `Animation Styling` for Spider-Verse-style held keys, configurable hold length, and timeline warnings when a future hold key would overlap an existing key
- `History Timeline` for ZBrush-style scene snapshots, restore points, milestone notes, branch tracking, and custom auto-save rules
- `Rotation Doctor` for rotation flip diagnosis, broad Euler cleanup, and one-key Blender-style Euler flipping from the Graph Editor or current keyed frame
- `Onion Skin` in `3D Ghost` mode
- `Dynamic Parenting`
- `Hand / Foot Hold`, mainly the foot-hold workflow
- `Timeline Notes`

Other tabs are present in the interface, but they are still closer to preview or in-progress sections at the moment.

`Version 0.3.1`

## What Is New In 0.3.1

- `Character Freeze` adds a safe skinned-mesh cleanup path for RapidRig-style characters. It can reset bad mesh translate and rotate values to `0`, scale to `1`, preserve skin weights and influences, and use a visible-mesh fallback when Maya has no hidden original shape.
- `Rotation Doctor` adds `Flip Current Key`, and the Floating Graph Editor adds `Euler Flip`, for a Blender-style Euler fix that rewrites the selected Graph Editor rotation key, or current-frame selected-control key, to the nearest safe equivalent rotation.
- `Animation Assistant` adds an early pose-balance view with floor plane, contact points, center-of-gravity setup, viewport badge, and support-area drawing. This weight / pose balance check is unfinished and should be treated as preview.
- `Floating Graph Editor` is now dockable, can include a DAG-only Outliner, has cycle infinity controls, and opens or closes from hotkeys more reliably.
- `Floating Channel Box` opens near the cursor, edits selected object channels more reliably, supports opacity customization, and avoids staying above every Windows app.
- `Animation Styling` adds Spider-Verse-style held keys, blocked-hold timeline warnings, and optional stepped curves.
- `Toolkit Bar` adds Tween Machine, tab navigation buttons, synced embedded toolbar, stronger Game Animation Mode visuals, and updated release packaging.
- `Scene Text Notes` now support larger default size, live sizing, auto wrap boxes, keyable visibility, pointer splines, and cleaner scene grouping.
- `Teacher Demo` rig duplication preserves more rig, material, visibility, and skinCluster data, adds clean delete, and stores student-readable edit logs in the Maya scene.
- `History Timeline` has stronger branching, snapshot filtering, storage caps, restore safety, per-scene history switching, performance guards, and clearer snapshot labels.
- `Aminate Mobu` adds MotionBuilder cleanup, skeleton mapping, characterization, History Timeline, packaging, and themed UI work.
- `Scene Helpers` is now usable for render setup, scene text notes, teacher-demo rig duplication, texture refresh, camera presets, and Game Animation Mode.
- `Controls Retargeter (Face and Body)` now works for retargeting animation between controls, between skeletons, from skeletons to controls, and between different rig layouts.
- `Toolkit Bar` now has the titleless compact bar, custom icons, Game Animation Mode, one-click package zip, animation-layer controls, and a small History Timeline strip.
- `History Timeline` adds scene snapshot saves, restore points, branch tracking, milestones, per-scene history folders, custom auto-save triggers, and an Auto History toggle for performance.
- `Control Picker` can scan selected control, geometry, and skeleton roots, group controls by body or face area, sync selection with Maya, and show list plus visual picker views.
- `Animators Pencil` adds scene-backed drawing marks, shape tools, marquee selection, camera notes, layers, frame markers, ghosting, and retiming helpers.
- `Animation Styling` adds Spider-Verse-style key holds so a key can automatically copy its value forward by a configurable number of frames.
- `Reference Manager` can package the current scene and external files into a zip with clearer missing-file labels and safer copy-only packaging.
- `Scene Text Notes` let teachers place visible notes in the viewport, resize them, color them, key visibility, and attach live pointer splines to animated controls.
- `Teacher Demo` duplicates a selected rig for side-by-side animation feedback while preserving animation, visibility, colors, materials, skinning, and cleanup controls. It also lists teacher edits in plain-English bullet points, for example control rotations or custom attribute changes, and undone edits disappear from the list.

## Install

1. Download `Aminate_v0.3.1.zip` from the latest release.
2. Unzip it.
3. Open the `aminate` folder inside the extracted folder.
4. Open Autodesk Maya.
5. Drag `Aminate drag and drop this onto Maya viewport.py` into the Maya viewport.
6. The tool installs, opens, and docks automatically.
7. After install, Maya opens Aminate and the Toolkit Bar when Maya starts.

## How To Use

### Toolkit Bar

This section is for the small repeat jobs students do while blocking and polishing animation.

Simple example:

1. Select one or more animated controls.
2. Use `-1` or `+1` to nudge the selected keys earlier or later.
3. Use `In` to add an inbetween key on the current frame.
4. Use `Cut` to remove a key on the current frame.
5. Use `Zero` to reset selected controls to translate 0, rotate 0, and scale 1.
6. Use `2s` to bake selected controls every two frames across the playback range.
7. Use `Open Toolkit Bar` if the small color-coded strip above Maya's timeline is closed.

### Scene Helpers

This section is for shot setup, timing cleanup, texture refresh, scene text notes, and the always-visible timeline helper strip.

Scene Text Notes let you place feedback directly in the Maya scene. Select a control or body part, type a note, pick a color, and click `Create Text Note`. You can key the note on or off, move it beside another selected control, recolor it, refresh the list, or delete it from the UI.

Floating Channel Box lets you tap `#` by default to open a small semi-transparent channel editor beside the cursor. It lists keyable and channel-box attributes for the current selection, edits matching attributes on all selected objects, and has customizable opacity and hotkeys.

Floating Graph Editor opens a semi-transparent native Maya Graph Editor clone. It uses Maya's real Graph Editor panel, can toggle on and off with a customizable hotkey, and has customizable opacity.

Game Animation Mode has its own Scene Helpers area. You can choose which setup actions run: 30 fps, realtime playback, Time Slider update view All, autosave backups, active viewports, texture reload, and weighted tangent conversion for existing animated curves.

Simple example:

1. Keep `Animation Layer Tint` on.
2. Select or change an animation layer in Maya.
3. The docked Toolkit Bar shows that layer name and tint color above the timeline.
4. Click the colored layer bar to change the current animation layer, rename it, or pick its color.
5. Use the blue game button at the far right of the Toolkit Bar for your checked game setup defaults.
5. Use `Set Up Render Environment` for the helper cameras, light, and cyclorama.

### Animation Styling

Use this tab for Spider-Verse-style held keys. Set `Hold Length` to `2`, turn on `Auto duplicate new keys`, and Aminate copies a newly keyed value forward by that many frames. If another key already sits between the source key and target hold frame, Aminate skips the duplicate and marks that timeline range red so you can see the overlap.

### Dynamic Parenting

This section is for props that need to move between parents, like a magazine moving between a hand, a gun, and world space.

Simple example:

1. Put the magazine where you want it.
2. Click `Add Object`.
3. Pick the hand or gun.
4. Click `Pick Parent`.
5. If you want the object to line up to that parent, click `Snap To Parent`.
6. If you want to save a custom grip position for that parent, move the object and click `Save This Offset`.
7. Click `Switch to this Parent`.
8. Use `World` when you want the object to let go.

### Reference Manager

This section is for moving a shot to another computer without hunting for referenced files by hand.

Simple example:

1. Save the current scene once.
2. Open `Reference Manager`.
3. Click `Refresh Needed Files`.
4. Keep `Include Maya references` on.
5. Keep `Include textures, audio, caches` on.
6. Click `Package Scene To Zip`.
7. Use the created zip on another machine.

### Hand / Foot Hold

This section is for planted contact, especially when a foot should stay in place while the body keeps moving.

Simple example:

1. Pick the foot control.
2. Set the frame where the foot first touches down.
3. Set the frame where the foot stops sticking.
4. Choose the world axis you want to lock.
5. Save the hold.
6. Use the saved hold list to turn rows on, off, update them, or delete them later.

### Onion Skin

The dependable mode in the current beta is `3D Ghost`.

Simple example:

1. Pick the rig root or object you want to preview.
2. Open the `Onion Skin` tab.
3. Choose your past and future ghost counts.
4. Keep the mode on `3D Ghost`.
5. Attach the preview.
6. Scrub the timeline to see the ghosted poses.

### Animators Pencil

This section is for drawing animation notes, arcs, contact marks, timing plans, simple 2D annotations, and camera-specific review notes inside Maya.

Simple example:

1. Open `Animators Pencil`.
2. Use `Open Blue Pencil` if you want Maya's native Blue Pencil drawing tools.
3. Use `Add Layer` for a script-managed layer.
4. Use `Drawing Tools` for pencil, brush, eraser, text, line, arrow, rectangle, or ellipse.
5. Use `Shape Tools` for quick line, arrow, rectangle, and ellipse notes with icon buttons.
6. Pick a color, size, and opacity.
7. Leave `Key camera when drawing` on if you want Camera Notes to remember the exact view.
8. Use `Camera Notes` to create the notes camera, key it to the current view, or look through it.
9. Click `Create Mark` to create a real Maya curve or text mark in front of the current camera.
10. Use `Add Key`, `Duplicate Previous Key`, `Retime`, `Add Frame Marker`, or `Build Ghosts` for drawing animation timing.
11. The script-managed marks are real Maya scene nodes, so the scene still shows them even without this script installed.

Camera Notes example:

1. Move the viewport to the angle where you want to draw.
2. Draw a pencil mark or shape with `Key camera when drawing` on.
3. Aminate creates or updates the Camera Notes camera on that frame.
4. Move to another frame and draw from another angle.
5. The Camera Notes camera keys to that new view, so students can scrub through notes from the same angles used when the marks were made.

### History Timeline

This section is for saving bigger restore points than Maya undo can safely handle.

Simple example:

1. Save the Maya scene once.
2. Open `History Timeline`.
3. Click `Save Step` before trying a risky change.
4. Click `Save Milestone` for important poses such as `good blocking` or `before polish`.
5. Pick a row and click `Restore` to return the whole scene to that snapshot.
6. Use the small history blocks above the animation-layer bar on the Toolkit Bar for quick save and restore while animating.
7. Restoring a snapshot jumps to that saved scene state without creating a new snapshot or moving the history order.
8. If you restore an older snapshot and keep working, Aminate creates a new colored branch instead of overwriting later saves.
9. The Toolkit Bar history squares keep showing all snapshots, so future work stays visible when you jump back.
10. Use the Branch menu and `Switch Branch` to jump between different save branches, or `Rename Branch` to give a branch a clearer name.
11. Check `History size` to see how much disk space the saved scene snapshots use together.
12. Use `Set Snapshot Cap` to limit automatic history growth. `0` means no cap.
13. Use `Delete All Snapshots` if you want to clear the scene history folder and remove all small snapshot squares.
14. By default, Aminate also watches for Maya action changes and saves sidecar snapshots after actions when the scene has already been saved.
15. Use `Auto History Save Rules` to keep full save mode on, or turn it off and tick only the custom triggers you want, such as keyframes, constraints, nodes, animation layers, parenting, references, transforms, or materials.
16. Notes, colors, branch ids, auto-save rules, and changed-node metadata are stored in the sidecar history folder beside the scene.

### Timeline Notes

This section is for colored timeline ranges with readable notes attached to them.
Use the `Toolkit Bar` tab or the docked Toolkit Bar when you need key nudging, inbetweens, reset pose, bake-on-twos, Game Animation Mode, or Animation Layer Tint next to timeline review.

Simple example:

1. Highlight a range in the time slider.
2. Open `Timeline Notes`.
3. Leave the auto highlighted-range option on if you want the note to follow the selected range.
4. Type the full note text.
5. Pick a color.
6. Add the note.
7. Scrub through the timeline to read the notes in the live reader.
